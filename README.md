## Overview

web browser loads a webpage using various protocols one of them called (DNS) it's Domain Name System protocol to convert a domain name into an IP address.
DNS is like the phone book of the Internet; it takes in domain names (much like human names) and turns them into IP addresses (much like phone numbers).
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. It is also referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and domain name -- that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.

End users use URLs by typing them directly into the address bar of a browser or by clicking a hyperlink found on a webpage, bookmark list, in an email or from another application.
